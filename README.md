## Portfolio Generator

# Description 
In this activity, I builded a command-line tool that generates an HTML portfolio page from user input.

# Instructions 
* Your application should prompt the user for information like their name, location, bio, LinkedIn URL, and GitHub URL. Feel free to add any additional prompts you think of.

* An HTML document containing the information collected from the prompts should be constructed and written to the file system. Make sure to add some CSS styling to the document.

* Youâ€™ll need the following tools and technologies to accomplish this:

  * `fs` for writing to the file system

  * `inquirer` version 8.2.4 for collecting user input

  * String template literals for generating a string version of the HTML document before it is written to the file system
